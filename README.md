# 🌼 My Data Science Journey Begins – With Krishna By My Side 🌼

> "Do your duty, and do not concern yourself with the results." – *Bhagavad Gita, 2.47*

Hello there! 🙏

Welcome to the very beginning of my data science learning journey. This is not just a repository of code and notebooks—this is a reflection of **faith, effort, and continuous growth**. As a devotee of Lord Krishna, I walk this path with trust in His guidance and in the process itself.

## 💡 Why I'm Here

I used to search for the perfect roadmap, the ideal course, the ultimate guide. But I’ve come to understand that learning—like life—is not a straight line. There is **no single perfect path** to mastering data science. Instead, there’s **my path**, unfolding one step at a time.

So here I am...  
Starting where I am,  
With what I have,  
Trusting in Him,  
And doing my very best every day. 🙌

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here

This repository is a growing garden of all I learn—mistakes, breakthroughs, challenges, and little victories. You’ll find:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis notes and examples  
- 🧠 Machine Learning experiments  
- 🔢 Math and Statistics concepts  
- 🧹 Data cleaning tips and tricks  
- 🪄 Projects inspired by real-world problems  
- 🕉️ Reflections and quotes that kept me grounded

## 🛤️ My Guiding Principles

- **Shraddha (Faith)** – I believe that sincere effort never goes to waste.
- **Sadhana (Discipline)** – I will show up even on tough days.
- **Seva (Service)** – I aim to use data to make the world a bit better.
- **Surrender** – I let go of perfectionism and trust in Krishna's plan.

## 🌼 A Note to Myself

Dear Krishna,  
You know my dreams even before I whisper them.  
Guide me through confusion, strengthen me through challenge,  
And let this journey be one of knowledge, humility, and joy.  
Let me never forget *why* I started.

## 🚀 Let's Begin

With faith in my heart and curiosity in my mind,  
Let this be Day One of something beautiful.

Jai Shri Krishna 🦚
